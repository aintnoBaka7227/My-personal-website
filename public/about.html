<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A self-driven and dynamic first year computer science student who is curious about technology and have 
  a passion for web development and design. I also enjoy spending time playing volleyball and basketball!

<p>Currently, I am working on front-end development with minimal experience using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  I am open to any web development projects or working positions including part-time, full-time and internships.
  I am eager for any learning opportunities and can do any unpaid projects for experiences.</p>
