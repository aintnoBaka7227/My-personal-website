<h1> Best Anime/Mangas so far By Revy </h1>
<hr />
<h2> I. Animes </h2>
<h3> Shin Seiki Evangelion </h3>
<p> Dark fantasy, sci-fi anime. If your life is full of hapiness, give it a try. It's gonna make you cry.</p>
<h3> Jujutsu Kaisen </h3>
<p> Best shounen in recent years in my opinion, probably best action anime so far by Mappa Studio. <br />
New contents, exciting verse with rich stories and diverse characters. <br />
Don't miss it, guys! <br />
</p>
<h3> High school DxD </h3>
<p> I didn't intend to find out about this anime but... <br />
I know... 18+ content, spicy stuffs, but it is fun, wild story with goofy characters. <br />
Give it a try, men of culture! <br />
</p>
<h2> II. Mangas </h2>
<h3> Berserk </h3>
<p> Needless to say, This one is a masterpiece. If you think Evangelion is dark, Berserk is the definition <br />
of depression. Read this if you want to become a man, boys. Badass protagonist, fast-pace storyline, full  <br />
of emotional moments. God-tier manga! <br />
Ps: Author die, so... we won't be able to see Guts finding his own happiness anymore... <br />
</p>
<h3> Summer Time Rendering </h3>
<p> When it comes to time traveling and scifi/horrow mangas, this one by Yasuki Tanaka is top-knot. <br />
Thrilling, scary moments with unexpected twists will make your brain overflow with informations. <br />
Try to keep up with protagonist in his "one in a life time aventure". <br />
</p>
<h3> DeathNote</h3>
<p> Common, man. Who don't know this manga? Among all of the manga I have read, this one is unique. What will you do if you have the power to control people's lives? <br />
Will you be able to keep your sanity knowing you kill someone without even have to touch them. <br />
NO ones will be able to find out about your identity, isn't it? <br />
Ps: there is no antagonists or protagonists in this manga... You are the one to decide so... Enjoy! <br />
</p>
